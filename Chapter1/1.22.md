### 1.22 [5] Suppose you were given a task at one of the transformation levels shown in Figure 1.9, and required to transform it to the level just below. At which level would it be most difficult to perform the transformation to the next lower level? Why?

I think starting from ISA layer to translate it below and below
it will be harder and harder.
Because ISA is like a software layer still, and most algorithmic tasks could be translated to ISA in a few best ways, there are not so much best solutions to it.

But when it comes to specific microarchitecture, even for the same ISA, there could be so more solutions.
And the same is both for circuits and transistor solutions.

But this is my opinion.

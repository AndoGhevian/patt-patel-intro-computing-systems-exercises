### 1.15 [7] Identify one advantage of programming in a higher-level language compared to a lower-level language. Identify one disadvantage.

High-level languages mostly independent of the computer
on which the program execute, of course after translation to computer instruction set. So for that
reason we say highl-level languages at their best are
"machine independent".

Also it gives ability to abstract away tasks from computer
itself, on which it will be executed.

On the other hand, it does not allow to use the whole
computitional power (speed) of a particular machine on which
it will execute, which is possible with Assembly Language, which is actual interface between any
computer program on any language and a hardware
that a program will execute on.

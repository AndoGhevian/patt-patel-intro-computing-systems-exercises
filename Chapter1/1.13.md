### 1.13 [4] Two computers, A and B, are identical except for the fact that A has a subtract instruction and B does not. Both have add instructions. Both have instructions that can take a value and produce the negative of that value. Which computer is able to solve more problems, A or B? Prove your result.

B can implement subtraction of 2 values through
algorithm, which is:
1. negate expected subtrahend value
2. add minuend to result of previous step

Considering this algorithm as computable, finit, and definitive task we can say that anything can perform
A is performable by B.

A can implement negation through 2 step algorithm:
1. subtract some number from itself to get 0
2. subtract from 0 a value to negate

So negation is performable by machine A.

So A and B can perform all exact tasks, no more, no less.

### 1.7 [3] The discussion of abstraction in Section 1.3.1 noted that one does not need to understand the makeup of the components as long as “everything about the detail is just fine.” The case was made that when everything is not fine, one must be able to deconstruct the components, or be at the mercy of the abstractions. In the taxi example, suppose you did not understand the component, that is, you had no clue how to get to the airport. Using the notion of abstraction, you simply tell the driver, “Take me to the airport.” Explain when this is a productivity enhancer, and when it could result in very negative consequences.

if Taxi driver know's how to get to Airport and is not
a maniac this a good abstraction to describe intent and to effectively get to the airport. It is productivity enhancer, because taxi driver in oposit to use, maybe drive to airport every day, and he very likely to know the best way to get there.

On the other hand, if he is a maniac, and we dont know exact way to get there, he could drive us
to unfamiliar place, and things could end badly, even though i've seen a lot of horror movies, so i have a
well-developed paranoia.

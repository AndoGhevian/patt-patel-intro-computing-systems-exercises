### 1.9 [1] Are natural languages capable of expressing algorithms?

Algorithm itself assume step-by-step procedure descibtion of a problem
using any language, that should have 3 properties:

1. definitness - steps are precise and not ambiguous
2. effectively computable - steps could be computed by
a unversal turing machine
3. finitness - procedure should terminate after some finit number of steps.

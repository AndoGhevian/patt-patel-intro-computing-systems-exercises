### 1.17 [1] Briefly describe the difference between an ISA and a microarchitecture.

ISA defines actions that computer program can do to tell computer to do something, and the responses of a computer as a machine to those actions.

Microarchitecture on the other hand defines how those responses are accoplished inside machine itself, although
it is still not define full implementation of machine
as an electrons flow controller, and even not as a digital states of 0's and 1's controller.

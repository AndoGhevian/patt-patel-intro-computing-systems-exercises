### 1.20 [4] The levels of transformation in Figure 1.9 are often referred to as levels of abstraction. Is that a reasonable characterization? If yes, give an example. If no, why not?

Yes, it is reasonable, because if someone asume that underlying layers work as expected, no one needs to know how they work, to accomplish tasks on that system.

Examples:
1. If it is enough to be solved, then someone could simply descibe a problem in natural language and it will be solved somehow, even though a person describing it maybe does not understand
how to make it be solved by a system.
2. even if someone know in ISA layer what actions/responses are supported and expected by a computer
he does not need to know how those actions are transformed to actual results of a machine.

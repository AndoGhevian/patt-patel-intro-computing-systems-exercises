### 1.11 [4] For each characteristic of an algorithm, give an example of a procedure that does not have the characteristic and is therefore not an algorithm.

my answers will satisfy the rest of proprites, except mentioned one.

#### 1
definitness

here is 1 step procedure

"calculate the sum of distances
taxi driver drives one passanger from repoublic square to airport
and the second drive of a second passanger from airport
to republic square"

Even though this procedure seems to have both properies of finitness and is effectively calculatable, it is leak definitiness of actual distances the taxi drove.

#### 2
effectively calculatable

"There are point on a road A and B. There is a George whos step is 40 cm long. Measure distance between A and B through straight line by steps of a George, given it is exact multiple of 40"

This procedure describing the problem and its solution
has properties of definitiness and finitness, but leak
effective computability because it is impossible for
computer to compute this task, but it can complete
human George.

#### 3
finitness of procedure

It is impossible to calculate last prime number, even though
it is precise and computable task.

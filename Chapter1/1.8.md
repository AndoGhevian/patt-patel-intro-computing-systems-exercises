### 1.8 [5] John said, “I saw the man in the park with a telescope.” What did he mean? How many reasonable interpretations can you provide for this statement? List them. What property does this sentence demonstrate that makes it unacceptable as a statement in a program?

If we continue the story of taxist from previous question, then john being a maniac taxist, who already drive too far, and start to explain me consequences, he could probably mean that he is killing people with cutting them with telescopes, i think he mean that.

There are 4 interpretations that i can think of as a well-developed paranoic from horror movies:

1. he killing people using telescope to cut them
2. he killing people who use telescope on the park
3. he just see a person in the park who use telescope
4. he see a person walking in the park, looking in the telescope from his home

This sentence is ambiguous and on the other hand does not describe any computition to carry on by any universal turing machine. It is simply a past things description.

### 1.3 [1] What difficulty with analog computers encourages computer designers to use digital designs?

Difference is that analog machines use for measurement
differences between physical quantities such as distances or weight or voltage, whcih are continuous and constantly changing values, and so it made it hard
to add precision to measurement process itself.

On the other hand, digital machines operate on finit
set of digits, to do measurements, so by design they are allready give
some specific precision results, so it is easier to
measure with.

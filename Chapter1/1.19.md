### 1.19 [1] List the levels of transformation and name an example for each level.

1. The Problem: Natural language definition of a problem: get 3 numbers and then calculate multiplication of 3rd with sum of first 2.
2. Algorithm: define unambiguous step-by-step procedure
description of a problem: 1) calculate sum of first 2, 2) calcuate multiplication of previous step result with 3rd number  
3. The Program: use some "machine language" without ambiguity to describe instrctions to computer to perform (to implement) algorithm. NASM code:
    1. mov rax,rdi
    1. add rax,rsi
    1. mul rdx
    1. ret ; here given result is no more than 64 bit value
       ; we already have result in rax where rdx is filled 0
4. ISA: translate program to computers instruction set, which is the actions combination to perform by a program on a computer to get expected result. I can not give a result of previous assembly program in 0's and 1's. Sorry
5. Microarchitecture: for example "AMD K8 Hammer" which is the first amd implementation of x64, so 64 bit rax and so on registers exist.
6. Logic Circuit: Athlon 64 is the processor based on that previous microarchitecture
7. Device: Semiconductor technology: from wikipedia - The Athlon 64 CPUs have been produced with 130 and 90 nm silicon on insulator (SOI) process technologies

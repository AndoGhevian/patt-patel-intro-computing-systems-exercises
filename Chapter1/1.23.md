### 1.23 [5] Why is an ISA unlikely to change between successive generations of microarchitectures that implement it? For example, why would Intel want to make certain that the ISA implemented by the Pentium III is the same as the one implemented by the Pentium II? Hint: When you upgrade your computer (or buy one with a newer CPU), do you need to throw out all your old software?

Of course not. ISA is like automobile things required for
a driver to drive it. It is ideal, we do not need to change it.
But underlying structure we questioning about cost and
performance and energy use, so we need to optimize
those crieries more and more through each new microarchitecture.

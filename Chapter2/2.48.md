### 2.48 Convert the following decimal numbers to hexadecimal representations of 2’s complement numbers.
1. a. 256
1. b. 111
1. c. 123,456,789
1. d. −44

#### Solution

first we will convert those magnitudes to unsigned integer data type and prepend a 0, after, in case if initial value is negative we will convert result to 2's complement representation
of appropriate negative number.

there after we need to sign extend results such it is
become representable through hex digits, i.e. result
digits count is multiple of 4.

#### a. 256

256 = 2^8 = 100000000u = 0100000000

Now we need to sext it by 2 0's (sign bit) to be able to
validly represent it through hex digits.

SEXT(0100000000) = 0001 0000 0000

x100

done!

#### b. 111

Now we can do easier if it is positive number.
We can immediately represent it in a sum of powers of 16
and thereafter if its most significant digit's binary representation has a first digit 1, which is not positive case in
2's complement, we can add additional hex 0 to it, and make it positive signed.

Now we start from maximum powers of 16

111 = 16 * 6 + 15 = x6f

Now we have 6 which is in 4 bits: 0110, so it start with 0 for positive 2's complement representation to be valid, so we are done!

#### c. 123,456,789

we will first find maximum power of 16 fit in this, and its coefitient:

16^3 = 4096

16 000000 < 16^6 < 25 000000

So it gives 7 zeros

we need one more and thats it

so we need to multiply that by 16,
but in that case we get:

256 000000 < 16^7 < 400 000000

So we get number which is more we need, so we will use
power of 6 not 7.

we even can find possible coefitioents that fit:

16 000000 < 16^6 < 25 000000

we need at least to multiply by 5 to more than 100 000 000

And maximum 8, because 16 000000 * 8 = 128 000 000

so possible coefitioents are 5, 6, 7

16^6 = 2^24 = 1024 * 1024 * 16 = 1048576 * 16 = 16 777216

So it is obviously 7.

so we now have 16^6 * 7 + ... = 123,456,789

123456789 - 117440512 = 6016277 = 16^5 * x + ....

16^5 = 1048576

so we have coefitient 5.

6016277 - 5242880 = 773397 = 16^4 * x + ....

16^4 = 65536

773397 - 65536 * 11 = 52501 = 16^3 * x + ....

coefitient is 11

16^3 = 4096

52501 - 4096 * 12 = 3349 = 16^2 * x + ....

coefitient 12

then 13 for 16^2

21 = 16^1 * 1 + 16^0 * 5

we get:

x75BCD15

Now because we need 2's complement, and 7 is 0111 it is good. done!

#### d. −44

It will be easy to do this through binary to hex.

as binary powers coefitients simply 0 or 1, we will go from
maximum powers of 2 and will find each coefitient from most significant bit.

starting from 2^5 = 32

44 = 101100 -> 6 digits

SEXT_div_4(0101100) = 00101100

now make this negative:

11010011 + 1 = 11010100 = xD4

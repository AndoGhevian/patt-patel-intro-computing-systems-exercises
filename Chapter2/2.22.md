### 2.22 Create two 16-bit 2’s complement integers such that their sum causes an overflow.

i will take negative ones for example to seem a little harder.

lets take any 2 integers representations sum of which is
less than -2^15.

for example -2^14 + -2^14 - 1.

 2^14 = 01000000 00000000

-2^14 = 10111111 11111111 + 1 = 11000000 00000000

-2^14 - 1 = 10111111 11111111

sum of those will give:

01111111 11111111

which is maxmium positive number = 2^15 - 1

So it is OVERFLOW.

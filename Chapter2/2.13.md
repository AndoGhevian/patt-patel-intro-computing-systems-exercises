### 2.13 Without changing their values, convert the following 2’s complement binary numbers into eight-bit 2’s complement numbers.

1. a. 1010
1. b. 011001
1. c. 1111111000
1. d. 01

#### Solutions

#### a.

For changing a representation length of 2's complement numbers
we need to apply sign-extension operation, abbreviated as
SEXT.

Here we have then for 1010 = 11111010

#### b.

011001 = 00011001

#### c.

If we take the minimum number of bits after which sign bit is constant and contiguous, we can consider:

1000 can be sign extended to given 1111111000, and so
these are simply different length representations for the same
number in 2's complement form.

Now we can simply SEXT it to 8 bits, or which is the same,
sign-truncate it to 8 bits.

so we get 11111000.

#### d.

01 is SEXT to 00000001.

### 2.20 The following binary numbers are four-bit 2’s complement binary numbers. Which of the following operations generate overflow? Justify your answer by translating the operands and results into decimal.
1. a. 1100 + 0011
1. b. 1100 + 0100
1. c. 0111 + 0001
1. d. 1000 − 0001
1. e. 0111 + 1001

#### a.

valof(1100) = valof(0) - valof(01) - valof(10),
as i see because of fact that representations
of values are connectde by formula:

representation(value + 1) = representation(value) + representation(1)

because of that fact, we simply can simply

consider that all 1111...11 is -1 all othe negative values
are calculated by subtracting powers of 2 where in positional
binary representation there is 0.

So we get:

for 1100 -> -1 - 2^0 * 1 - 2^1 * 1 = -4

1100 = -4
0011 = 3

1100 + 0011 = 1111
-4   + 3    = -1

No overflow

#### b.

1100 + 0100 = 0000
-4   + 4    = 0

No overflow

#### c.

0111 + 0001 = 1000 = -8
7    + 1    =         8

Overflow happen because no enough bits to represent that sum:
two positive numbers give sign bit 1.

#### d.

here we have a binary subtraction:

1000 - 0001 = 0111 = 7
-8   - 1    =      = -9

Here we have overflow, because we are unable to represent -9
in 2's complement form with 4 bits.

#### e.

0111 + 1001 = 0000
7    + -7   = 0

No overflow

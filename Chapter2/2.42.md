### 2.42 A computer programmer wrote a program that adds two numbers. The programmer ran the program and observed that when 5 is added to 8, the result is the character m. Explain why this program is behaving erroneously.

Ah, its because hes inputs 5 and 8 read as ASCII characters, not numeric values from keyboard.

So ASCII character 5 code is decimal 53, and 8 code is 56, so sum is 109 which is a decimal code of character m. So when he sends result of numeric addition to display, it is considered
as ASCII data type, so 109 decimal occures to be a representation for ASCII character m.

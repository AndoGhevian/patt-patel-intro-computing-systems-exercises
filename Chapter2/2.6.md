### 2.6 Write the six-bit 2’s complement representation of −32.

1.first lets represent positive integer with same magnitude of 32 in 2's complement and then calculate negative one representation.

32 = 2^0 * a0 + 2^1 * a1 ...
because 32 is even then a0 = 0, because the rest is dividable by 2, and if it is 1, then the whole thing will be odd.

32 - 2^0 * 0 = 2^1 * a1 + 2^2 * a2 ... =>

32 / 2 = 16 = 2^0 * a1 + 2^1 * a2 ... =>

again, because of the same reason a1 = 0

then 8 = ... so a2 = 0

then 4 = ... so a3 = 0

then 2 = ... so a4 = 0 

then 1 = 2^0 * a5 + ... so a5 = 1

0 = the rest 2 powers sum, so all coefitients are 0

we get bit representation 100000 for 6 bit representation of 32
using positional binary representation...... wait a minute....

confusion happens. First we need to find out the possible representable range in 2's complement form for 6 bits.

for 6 bits we have range from 0 to 2^5 - 1 = 31 positive numbers
and from -32 to -1 appropriately for negative numbers.

where value for -32 is choosen specially so that it conforms
to representations of range -31 to +31.

As we know each representation(value +1) = representation(value) + representation(1).
So it is appropriate to assign that last code of 100000 to -32.

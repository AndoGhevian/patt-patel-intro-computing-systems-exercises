### 2.4 Given n bits, how many unsigned integers can be represented with the n bits? What is the range of these integers?

using n bits we can represent 2^n codes of unsigned integers.
But the range depends on our intention. We can represent any range, even unsigned integers that are not contiguous.

But when we talk about data types, which are representations used by computer, then we have unsigned integer data type, which assume binary string with positional notation of n bits.
In that case it is possible to represent range of unsigned integers from 0 to 2^n - 1.

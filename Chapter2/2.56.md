### 2.56 Define a new eight-bit floating point format with one sign bit, four bits of exponent, using an excess-7 code (i.e., the bias is 7), and three bits of fraction. If xE5 is the bit pattern for a number in this eight-bit floating point format, what value does it have? (Express as a decimal number.)

Lets define it.

for exponent 4 bits first lets define decoding as a normalized
form scientific number representation, when 4 bits are not
all 1's or all 0's.

in this case we have values from 0001 through 1110 mapped
to [1, 14] - 7 = [-6, 7], where:

0001 -> -6
0010 -> -5
...
0111 -> 0
1000 -> 1
...
1110 -> 7

Now 0000 and 1111 are reserved, where 1111 is reserved for such special values as infinity, when fraction part bits are all 0's and if sign is 0 then +Infinity, 1 is -Infinity.

For representing the rest values between [0, 2^-6] (0 included)
we use subnormal values.

where value left to binary point assume to be 0 and even though
exponent ecess code is 0000 but it will correspond to exponent -6.

So we will have values formula: (-1)^S * 0.b1_b2_b3 * 2^-6

number of number are represented is 2^3 = 8

minimum is 2^-3 * 2^-6 = 2^-9

Now we have 8 bit value: xE5 = 11100101 = 1 1100 101

1100 -> 5

-(1)^1 * 1.101 * 2^5 = -110100 = -13 * 4 = -52

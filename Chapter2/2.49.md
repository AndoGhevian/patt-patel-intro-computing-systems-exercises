### 2.49 Perform the following additions. The corresponding 16-bit binary numbers are in 2’s complement notation. Provide your answers in hexadecimal.
1. a. x025B + x26DE
1. b. x7D96 + xF0A0
1. c. xA397 + xA35D
1. d. x7D96 + x7412
1. e. What else can you say about the answers to parts c and d?

#### a. x025B + x26DE

Now we have 2 positive numbers. So lets perform sum in hex and see
maybe there is overflow.

x2939, i calculated in a mind, no overflow.

#### b. x7D96 + xF0A0

positive and negative sum.

x6E36 > 0

#### c. xA397 + xA35D

x46F4 and 1 carry. Now they are both negative, but result is not. So we have overflow.

#### x7D96 + x7412

xF18A is overflow, because 7 is positive bit.

#### e. What else can you say about the answers to parts c and d?

I already say, there is overflow.

And i can mention easy way to find out if hex digit indicates negatvive 2's complement number.

We need simply to see if digit is greater/equal of 8 or not.
If it is, then it is negative, otherwise it is positive.

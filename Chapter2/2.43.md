### 2.43 Translate the following ASCII codes into strings of characters by interpreting each group of eight bits as an ASCII character.
1. a. x48656c6c6f21
1. b. x68454c4c4f21
1. c. x436f6d70757465727321
1. d. x4c432d32

One possibility of information representation, which is used usually by input and output devices such as keywboard and display for input and output operations is ASCII data type.

So number 5 could be represented both as in unsigned integer, 2's complement, signed magnitude data types, the same way it could be represented as ASCII code data type. In this case 5 is considered as ASCII character.

now, if we have ASCII codes, we can represent these as ASCII characters string, interpreting each 8 bits as an ASCII code representation for some particular ASCII character.

Also because each number starts with x, it means it is hex notation.

1 hex digit corresponds to 4 binary digits. so we have:

#### a. x48656c6c6f21

x 48 65 6c 6c 6f 21

01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111 00100001

Wow, wow. It's too much, there is no reason to convert those to 8 bit binary numbers, because we already have a table of ASCII codes in hex, and even more, there is no binary representations table in the book appendix, it will be too long column to express.

So we have:

1. x48 = H
1. x65 = e
1. x6c = l
1. x6c = l
1. x6f = o
1. x21 = !

answer: Hello!

#### b. x68454c4c4f21

x 68 45 4c 4c 4f 21

1. x68 = h
1. x45 = E
1. x4c = L
1. x4c = L
1. x4f = O
1. x21 = !

answer: hELLO!

#### c. x436f6d70757465727321

x 43 6f 6d 70 75 74 65 72 73 21

1. x43 = C
1. x6f = o
1. x6d = m
1. x70 = p
1. x75 = u
1. x74 = t
1. x65 = e
1. x72 = r
1. x73 = s
1. x21 = !

answer: computers!

#### d. x4c432d32

x 4c 43 2d 32

1. x4c = L
1. x43 = C
1. x2d = -
1. x32 = 2

answer: LC-2

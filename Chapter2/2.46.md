### 2.46 Convert the following hexadecimal numbers to binary.
1. a. x10
1. b. x801
1. c. xF731
1. d. x0F1E2D
1. e. xBCAD

#### Solution

ok, lets represent hex number general form in binary form to understand how they are interconnected in hex to binary direction:

note 16 = 2^4

h...a4a3a2a1a0 = a0 + 2^4 * a1 + 2^8 * a2 + ... =

a0 corresponds to 16 possible digits from 0 through 15, which have obvious contiguous representations in unsigned interger data type with 4 bits:

0000
0001
...
1110
1111

here we have 16 digits.

now as we see each time we shift next digit by 4 bits, which is opening enough space to append this binary 4 bit representation for that particular digit.

so we see that it is enough to append all 4 bit binary representation of digits to get following hex number

#### a. x10

0001 0000

#### b. x801

0100 0000 0001

#### c. xF731

1111 0111 0011 0001

#### d. x0F1E2D

0000 1111 0001 1110 0010 1101

#### e. xBCAD

1011 1100 1010 1101

### 2.54 Fill in the truth table for the equations given. The first line is done as an example.
1. Q1 = NOT(NOT(X) OR (X AND Y AND Z))
1. Q2 = NOT((Y OR Z) AND (X AND Y AND Z))

X | Y | Z | Q1 | Q2
|---|---|---|---|---|
|0|0|0|0|1
|0|0|1|1|1
|0|1|0|1|1
|0|1|1|1|1
|1|0|0|1|1
|1|0|1|1|1
|1|1|0|1|1
|1|1|1|0|0

In english this could be stated as:

#### Q1 = NOT(NOT(X) OR (X AND Y AND Z))
these are the same:
1. "It is not the case that X is false or X, Y, Z are all true"
1. "it is not the case that X,Y,Z are all true or are all false"
1. "there are at least one true and one false statement in X,Y,Z"

1. NOT(NOT(X) OR (X AND Y AND Z))
1. NOT(AND(x, Y, Z) OR AND(NOT(x), NOT(Y), NOT(Z)))
1. XOR(X, Y) OR XOR(X, Z) OR XOR(Y, Z)

#### Q2 = NOT((Y OR Z) AND (X AND Y AND Z))
These are the same:
1. "It is not the case that at least Y Or Z is true and that all X,Y,Z are all true"
1. It is not the case thet X,Y,Z are all true.

NOT((Y OR Z) AND (X AND Y AND Z)) = NOT(X AND Y AND Z)

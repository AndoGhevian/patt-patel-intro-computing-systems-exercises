### 2.35 In Example 2.11, what are the masks used for?

bit mask is used with bitwise AND to CLEAR (OFF) bits that are 0
in mask, and with bitwise OR to SET (ON) bits that are 1.

e.g.

11000010 AND 01111111 = 01000010

11000010 OR  00100000  = 11100010

but usually bit mask is used to isolate bits on which we are interested and ignore those that are not matter. This is done through AND logical operation agains some mask.

11000010 AND 11110000 = 11000000

so here we are interested only in first 4 bits, which are
1100.

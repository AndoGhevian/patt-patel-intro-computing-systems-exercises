### 2.16 Write the results of the following additions as both eight-bit binary and decimal numbers. For each part, use standard binary addition as described in Section 2.5.1.

1. a. Add the 1’s complement representation of 7 to the 1’s complement representation of −7.
1. b. Add the signed magnitude representation of 7 to the signed magnitude representation of −7.
1. c. Add the 2’s complement representation of 7 to the 2’s complement representation of −7.

#### Solutions

#### a.

1's complement representations are simply flipped bits.
So we get for 7 and -7 appropriately:

00000111 and 11111000 and adding those we get 11111111
which is representation for complement of 0 - 00000000.

So it is integer -0.

NOTE: we caluclate sum with standard binary addition way.

#### b.

signed magnitude representation assumes same representation simply
prepended with 1 if it is negative and 0 if positive.

So adding those 8-bit representation is strange:

00000111 is still 7 and 10000111 is -7. adding those representations give: 10001110, it looks like -14 ? (ironically)

#### c.

7 is still 00000111, and 2's complement -7 is 11111001.
adding these representations give us 100000000 9 bits, so it is
8 bits 0 with carry 1. it is 0.

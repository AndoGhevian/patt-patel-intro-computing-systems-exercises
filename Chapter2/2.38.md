### 2.38 If n and m are both four-bit unsigned numbers, and s is the four-bit result of adding them together, how can we determine, using only the logical operations described in Section 2.6, if an overflow occurred during the addition? Develop a “procedure” for doing so. The inputs to the procedure are n, m, and s, and the output will be a bit pattern of all 0s (0000) if no overflow occurred and 1000 if an overflow did occur

If overflow occure it means carry occure from most significant bit.

when considering most significant bits, we see that for this carry happen, 2 numbers must be such that counting from the end, on each bit column there must be at least 1 bit with value 1, and at some point there will encounter 2 1 bits on the same column.

There are 2 separate scenarios for this:

1. most significant column has 2 1 bits
1. most significant column has 1 1 bit

if both are 1 then carry already happen.

if there is only one 1, and sum gives an overflow, it will be 0
in the result otherwise there is no carry out from most signifcant bit.

So here is logical operations procedure for overflow:

AND(n, m) OR (OR(n, m) AND NOT(s))  AND
So here is logical operations procedure for overflow:

( AND(n, m) OR (OR(n, m) AND NOT(s)) ) AND 1000

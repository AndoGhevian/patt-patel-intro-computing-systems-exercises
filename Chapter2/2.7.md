### 2.7 Create a table showing the decimal values of all four-bit 2’s complement numbers.

As we know 2's complement representation divides all
possible codes to negative and non-negative numbers,
such that sum of representations of positive A and same magnitude -A representation is 0.

Positive numbers are represented as in unsigned integer representation, i.e. simple positional binary representation.
So we get for exact half of codes, codes with leading 0,
of range 0 to 7.

For negatives we have a fact of each code beeing represented so:

representation(value + 1) = representation(value) + representation(1)

so we get codes for values -7 through -1, where there is still one code left:

-1 = 1111
-2 = 1110
-3 = 1101
-4 = 1100
-5 = 1011
-6 = 1010
-7 = 1001

and finaly we have additional code for negative numbers which is 1000. and because we give you a formula of subsequent representations in this range of -7 through +7, we can say
-8 is 1000, because it would be convinient.

now the full list is:

 7 = 0111
 6 = 0110
 5 = 0101
 4 = 0100
 3 = 0011
 2 = 0010
 1 = 0001
 0 = 0000
-1 = 1111
-2 = 1110
-3 = 1101
-4 = 1100
-5 = 1011
-6 = 1010
-7 = 1001
-8 = 1000 (conventional assignment)

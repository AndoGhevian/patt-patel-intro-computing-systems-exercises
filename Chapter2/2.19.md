### 2.19 Express the negative value −27 as a 2’s complement integer, using eight bits. Repeat, using 16 bits. Repeat, using 32 bits. What does this illustrate with respect to the properties of sign-extension as they pertain to 2’s complement representation?

27 = 16 + 8 + 2 + 1 (did it in mind) = 11011 unsigned int

#### 8 bit -27 2's complement

8 bit 27 (positive) 2's complement will be:

00011011

now, -27 will be 2's complement representation:

11100101.

#### 16 bit -27 2's complement

16 bit magnitude

00000000 00011011

16 bit -27

11111111 11100101

#### 32 bit -27 2's complement

positive: 00000000 00000000 00000000 00011011

negative: 11111111 11111111 11111111 11100101

#### Answer

For positive numbers that are represented as positional binary numbers is obvious why we prepending 0's.

In the case of negative numbers, as we see this role is playing
1 digit, i mena instead of 0. And its result is the same as for sign-extension operation.

So sign-extension against 2's complement integer representation
is the same as if we convert same magnitude number to 2's complement integer.

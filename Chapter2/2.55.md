### 2.55 We have represented numbers in base-2 (binary) and in base-16 (hex). We are now ready for unsigned base-4, which we will call quad numbers. A quad digit can be 0, 1, 2, or 3.
1. a. What is the maximum unsigned decimal value that one can represent with 3 quad digits?
1. b. What is the maximum unsigned decimal value that one can represent with n quad digits? (Hint: Your answer should be a function of n.)
1. c. Add the two unsigned quad numbers: 023 and 221.
1. d. What is the quad representation of the decimal number 42?
1. e. What is the binary representation of the unsigned quad number 123.3?
1. f. Express the unsigned quad number 123.3 in IEEE floating point format.
1. g. Given a black box that takes m quad digits as input and produces one quad digit for output, what is the maximum number of unique functions this black box can implement?

#### a.
well if numbers expressed in positional form then maximum
quad number of 3 digits is 333 = 3 * 16 + 3 * 4 + 3 =
63

#### b.
well given for such representation we will have maximum value
33...3, to calculate it easly we can simply add 1 to it, and get: 30...0 and n 0's. So we have 3 * 4^n.

#### c.
023 + 221 = 310

#### d.
coming from maximum power of 4

42 = 4^2 * 2 + 4^1 * 2 + 4^0 * 2 = 222

#### e.

it asks simply for binary representation, not data type coresponding representation.

123.3 = 1*4^2 + 2*4^1 + 3*4^0 + 3*4^-1

each digit is representable through 2 bits and vice versa, each 2 bit represnetabtion is base-4 digit.

so previous representation is simply appended sequence of binary
representations.

01 10 11 . 11 = 011011.11

#### f.

from previous example we have 123.3 = 11011.11 = 1.101111 * 2^4

exponent excess code is 131 = 2^7 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 1000 0011

so we have 0 1000 0011 1011 1100 0000 0000 0000 000 =

0100 0001 1101 1110 0000 0000 0000 0000

#### g.

there are 4 digits. So m input combinations number is 4^m,
and for each such combination there are 4 different
possible outputs. So there 4^m * 4 = 4^(m + 1) possible combinations of (inputs, output)

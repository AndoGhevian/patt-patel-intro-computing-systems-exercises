### 2.53 Fill in the truth table for the equations given. The first line is done as an example. Express Q2 another way.
1. Q1 = NOT(A AND B)
1. Q2 = NOT(NOT(A) AND NOT(B))

A | B ||| Q1 | Q2
0   0     1    0
0   1     1    1
1   0     1    1
1   1     0    1

So Q2 is like saying: "it is not the case that A and B are true", second one Q2 is "it is not the case that A and B are false".

based on truth table
Q2 = A OR B

and Q1 = NOT(A) OR NOT(B) so we have:

"it is not the case that A and B are true" == "At least one of A or B is false"

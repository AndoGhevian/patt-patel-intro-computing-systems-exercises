### 2.1 Given n bits, how many distinct combinations of the n bits exist?

Each bit can get 2 values, 0 or 1. So given n bit representation has n cells to put 0 or 1, we can calculate
all possible such placements number as: 2 * 2 * ... * 2, where
2 is taken as factor n times. So result is 2 raised power of n.

2^n

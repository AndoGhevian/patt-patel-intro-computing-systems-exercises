### 2.50 Perform the following logical operations. Express your answers in hexadecimal notation.
1. a. x5478 AND xFDEA
1. b. xABCD OR x1234
1. c. NOT((NOT(xDEFA)) AND (NOT(xFFFF)))
1. d. x00FF XOR x325C

#### a. x5478 AND xFDEA

note, bitwise logical or is like subtraction
**without borrow**, where we subtracting 1 from places
where subtrahend bit is 0.

**It open gaps**

x5468

#### b. xABCD OR x1234

is like a sum **without carry**, where 1 is added where
second addend has bit 1.

**So esentially it fills the gaps**

We add hex-by-hex 

xBBFD

#### c. NOT((NOT(xDEFA)) AND (NOT(xFFFF)))

for hex not is like NOT(Digit) = F - Digit

AND op as we say is like open gaps where second operand
has gap.

So we get:

NOT(x2105 AND x0000) = NOT(x0000) = xFFFF

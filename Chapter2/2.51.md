### 2.51 What is the hexadecimal representation of the following numbers?
1. a. 25,675
1. b. 675.625 (i.e., 675 | 5 / 8 ), in the IEEE 754 floating point standard
1. c. The ASCII string: Hello

#### a. 25,675

There is no data type mentioned, so we will simply use positional notation with hexadecimal format.

16^4 = 65536
16^3 = 4096

so coefitient is 6 for 16^3

25675 - 16^3 * 6 = 1099

1099 - 16^2 * 4 = 75

so 16^2 coefitient is 4.

75 - 16^1 * 4 = 11 so coefitient is 4

and last one is 11

so we get representation in hex: x644B

#### b. 675.625 (i.e., 675 | 5 / 8 ), in the IEEE 754 floating point standard

lets represent it in normalized binary form.

675 = 2^9 + 163 = 2^9 + 2^7 + 35 = 2^9 + 2^7 + 2^5 + 2^1 + 1 =

= 1010100011

Now 5 / 8 = 2^-1*a1 + 2^-2*a2 + ...

5/4 = a1 + 2^-1*a2 + ...

a1 = 1

1/4 = 2-1*a2 + 2^-2*a3 + ...

a2 = 0

1/2 = 2^-1*a3 + 2^-2*a4 + ...

a3 = 1, and rest is 0

5/8 = 0.101

So we have 675.625 = 2^9 * 1.010100011101

expnent will be unsigned integer data type for number

127 + 9 = 136 = 2^7 + 2^3 = 10001000

Now we get 1 bit for positive sign

10001000 excess code exponent

0101 0001 1101 and 000... to fill 23 bits

0100 0100 0010 1000 1110 1000 0000 0000 8 * 4 = 32 bits

x4428E800

#### c. The ASCII string: Hello

ASCII codes are 8 bits which is 2 hex digits.

Now we have a table of ascii codes in hex inside the book.

### 2.17 Add the following 2’s complement binary numbers. Also express the answer in decimal.
1. a. 01 + 1011
1. b. 11 + 01010101
1. c. 0101 + 110
1. d. 01 + 10

#### Solution

because these are binary numbers in 2's complement representation,
but they have different lengthes, we need to bring them
to same length before any arithmetic operations between them.

For this reason we use operation of SEXT - Sign-Extension
to small length representation.

#### a.

01 = 1

1011 = -5

0001 + 1011 = 1100 = -(valof(0011) + 1) = -4

#### b.

11 = -1

01010101 = 1 + 4 + 16 + 64 = 85

11111111 + 01010101 = 01010100 = 84

#### c.

0101 = 5

110 = -2

0101 + 1110 = 0011 = 3

#### d.

01 = 1

10 = -2

01 + 10 = 11 = -1

### 2.2 There are 26 characters in the alphabet we use for writing English. What is the least number of bits needed to give each character a unique bit pattern? How many bits would we need to distinguish between upperand lowercase versions of all 26 characters?

n bits can distinguish maximum 2^n codes. so to distingusih 26
characters (codes) 4 bits are not enough (16 codes max). 5 bits is enough, there are 32 codes ossible to distinguish, so that even
6 codes are free to use for other pourposes. So we need 5 bits.

But to distinguish both upper/lower cases, we need twice that space. So 5 bits are not enough in this case. we need 1 more bit, in whihc case it is enough to present 2 * 26 different letters, upper/lower cases included. So we need 6 bits.

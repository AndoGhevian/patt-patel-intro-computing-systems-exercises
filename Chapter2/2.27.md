### 2.27 The LC-3, a 16-bit machine, adds the two 2’s complement numbers 0101010101010101 and 0011100111001111, producing 1000111100100100. Is there a problem here? If yes, what is the problem? If no, why not?

Well lets check:

 0101010101010101
+
 0011100111001111
=1000111100100100

Problem simply is that we have overflow to negative numbers.

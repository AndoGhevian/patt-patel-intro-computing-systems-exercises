### 2.12 If the last digit of a 2’s complement binary number is 0, then the number is even. If the last two digits of a 2’s complement binary number are 00 (e.g., the binary number 01100), what does that tell you about the number?

In case of non-negative numbers it is obvious that the minimum
power of 2 in the sum representation is 2^2, so the number
is dividable by 4.

in the case of negative numbers, that are oposite to appropriate
positive ones are need to be flipped and added 1:

so for those we will get positive representation as:

.....11 +

.....01

=
.....00

So magnitude its will be also dividable by 4, so yes.

what about tha last negative possible number, which is:

2^(n - 1) in case when n is all bits count for representation,
we get n should be at least 3, because otherwise range is smaller than 4 in its magnitude.

e.g.

for 2 bits we get max +1 and min -2.

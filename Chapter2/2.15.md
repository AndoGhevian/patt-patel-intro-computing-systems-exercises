### 2.15 It was demonstrated in Example 2.5 that shifting a binary number one bit to the left is equivalent to multiplying the number by 2. What operation is performed when a binary number is shifted one bit to the right?

first lets consider positive number representations:

after we shift we get shorter result, which we ill simply sign extend to preserve its value.

Now, given we shifted representation to right, then we lost
rightmost bit, and have each other addends powers of 2's near coefitioents
divided to 2.

So in the end we result the integer part of division of a number by 2.

So the operation we get is "integer division" by 2 without reminder.

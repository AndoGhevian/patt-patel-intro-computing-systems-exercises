### 2.10 Convert the following 2’s complement binary numbers to decimal.

1. a. 1010
1. b. 01011010
1. c. 11111110
1. d. 0011100111010011

#### Solution

a.

1010 is negative, so we first need to get same magnitude positive number by complementing and adding 1. and then append minus sign.

0101 + 0001 = 0110 = 6

so 1010 = -6

b.

as we see it is positive number, so its representation
supposed to be positional binary one.

lets sum powers of 2 where coefitient is 1.

2^1 + 2^3 + 2^4 + 2^6 = 10 + 16 + 64 = 90.

01011010 = 90

c.

it is negative, so fist need flip bits and add 1 to get same magnitude positive number representation:

flip-bits(11111110) + 1 = 00000001 + 1 = 00000010

now this poitional binary number represents decimal positive number 2.

So inital 2's complement representation 11111110 = -2

d.

is positive number, so as previous examples ets calulate it:

0011100111010011 ->

1 + 2^1 + 2^4 + 2^6 + 2^7 + 2^8 + 2^11 + 2^12 + 2^13 = 

= 3 + 16 + 64 + 128 + 256 + 2048 + 4096 + 8192 =

= 3 + 208 + 2304 + 4096 + 8192 =

= 3 + 8400 + 2304 + 4096 =

= 3 + 8400 + 6400 = 14803

### 2.3
a. Assume that there are about 400 students in your class. If every
student is to be assigned a unique bit pattern, what is the minimum
number of bits required to do this?

b. How many more students can be admitted to the class without
requiring additional bits for each student’s unique bit pattern?

#### Solution:

a)

We need to count minimum required length of a bit pattern so
their all combinations number is greater or equal to 400.

So we need find min(x) where 2^x >= 400.
lets use trial-error-method. For 8 bits we get 2^8 = 256 combinations. for 9 bits we get:

2^9 = 2 * 2^8 = 2 * 256 = 512 >= 400.

So we need at least 9 bit pattern.

b)

There will be additional 112 bit patterns free to use in a class.

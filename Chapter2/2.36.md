### 2.36 Refer to Example 2.11 for the following questions.
1. a. What mask value and what operation would one use to indicate that machine 2 is busy?
1. b. What mask value and what operation would one use to indicate that machines 2 and 6 are no longer busy? (Note: This can be done with only one operation.)
1. c. What mask value and what operation would one use to indicate that all machines are busy?
1. d. What mask value and what operation would one use to indicate that all machines are idle?
1. e. Using the operations discussed in this chapter, develop a procedure to isolate the status bit of machine 2 as the sign bit. For example, if the BUSYNESS pattern is 01011100, then the output of this procedure is 10000000. If the BUSYNESS pattern is 01110011, then the output is 00000000. In general, if the BUSYNESS pattern is:

    | b7 | b6 | b5 | b4 | b3 | b2 | b1 | b0 |
    
    the output is:

    | b2 | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  |

    Hint: What happens when you ADD a bit pattern to itself?

#### Solution

eight-bit BUSYNESS bit vector 11000010

#### a.
AND to Clear, 11111101 =>

11000010 AND 11111101 = 11000000

#### b.
Availability is shown by bit with value 1 in BUSYNESS bit vector.

So we will use OR to SET a bit.

11000000 OR 00100010 = 11100010

#### c.
need to clear all bits, so we will use AND.

11100010 AND 00000000 = 00000000

So all are 0 indicating that all are busy.

#### d.
OR to set all to 1 to be available.

00000000 OR 11111111 = 11111111

#### e
This last question makes me know that machines are numbered using their subscript, so it is 0 based number.

So mahcine 2 is actually 3rd one.

we can sum 5 times given BUSYNESS bit vector which will
one 5 positions left and make it 8th bit in representation.

so if we have repres(x), we do 5 * repres8(x) AND 10000000

So we get index 2 bit as a sign bit.

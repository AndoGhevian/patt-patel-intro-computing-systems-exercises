### 2.9 How many bits are needed to represent Avogadro’s number (6.02 ⋅ 10^23) in 2’s complement binary representation?

In 2's complement when we have n bits, 1 bit is intended to sign idenitification
and rest n-1 bits are for magnitude, so these are precision bits.

And also the maximum positive representable value in this case is
2^(n - 1) - 1

so lets solve this: 2^x - 1 >= 6.02 * 10^23

first lets find minimal x such that 2^x is at least have so many
digits as 10^23, i.e. 24.

2^10 = 1024

2^10 * 2^10 = 2^20 = 1048576 - 7 digits

2^20 * 2^20 = 2^40 = 1000000.000000 + 2359.627776 + 97152 * 1000000 =
627776 + 99511.000000 + 1000000.000000 = 1099511.627776 - 13 digits

2^40 * 2^20 = 2^60
1099511.627776 * 1048576 = 1152920.846336.000000 + 658270.846976
= 1.152920.000000.000000 + 1.504606.000000 + 846976 =
1.152921.504606.846976

Now there digits as many as ~ 10^18 has.

lets take a best number to multiply to get the rest 5 digits (5 + 18 = 23)

10^3 ~ 1024 <= 2^10 <= 2^20 <= 1.048576 ~ 10^6

considering 2^20, we see that:
2^20 / 2^4 = 65536 <= 100000

lets see inequalities:

2^60 = 1.152921.504606.846976

X

2^16 <= 100000 <= 2^17 = 65536 * 2 = 131072

But then we get 1 as a most significant digit. but in avogadro number there is 6 which is greater.

but here we see that in this case we can even multiply 100000 by 4 and it will be ok.

and we need to multiply it at least by 6 to get >= 6 as a most
significant digit.

but it will also be enogh. so we multiply both sides of inequality also by 8 which is 2^8.

So we get 2^60 * 2^16 * 2^3 = 2^79.

So we get x = 79, and so n - 1 = x = 79 so n = 80.

we need at least 80 bits. and it will be enough.

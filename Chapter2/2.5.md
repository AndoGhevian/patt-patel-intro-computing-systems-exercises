### 2.5 Using five bits to represent each number, write the representations of 7 and −7 in 1’s complement, signed magnitude, and 2’s complement integers.

In all those data types, representations of non-negative values are the same as in unsigned integer data type. So for +7 we have
5 bit representation 00111.

For -7 we get:

1's complement => we need to simply bitwise complement representation of +7 in that data type. so we get -7 = 11000.

signed magnitude => we simply track with last 5th bit the sign
of a value, so we get -7 = 10111 as aposed to +7 = 00111.

2's complement => here it is a little bit complex to explain reasons behind how engineers get to this representation, but
using simple formula describing how to get from A it's oposite
value representation for -A, which is:
1. bitwise complement of representation of A
2. add 1 to the result

So we get NOT(00111) + 00001 = 11001 for -7.

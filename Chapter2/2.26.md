### 2.26 You wish to express −64 as a 2’s complement number.
1. a. How many bits do you need (the minimum number)?
1. b. With this number of bits, what is the largest positive number you can represent? (Please give answer in both decimal and binary.)
1. c. With this number of bits, what is the largest unsigned number you can represent? (Please give answer in both decimal and binary.)

#### Solution

#### a.
-64 = -2^6, we need 7 bits.

#### b.
2^6 - 1 = 63 = 011111

#### c.
111111 = 2^7 - 1 = 127

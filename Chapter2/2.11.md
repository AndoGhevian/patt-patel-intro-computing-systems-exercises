### 2.11 Convert these decimal numbers to eight-bit 2’s complement binary numbers.

1. a. 102
1. b. 64
1. c. 33
1. d. −128
1. e. 127

#### Solutions

#### a.

given 102 is represented as a sum of powers of 2.

102 = 2^0*a0 + 2^1*a1 +...

where a0..an are less than 2 non-negative integers.

we get:

a0 is 0 -> because 102 is even

=> 51 = (102 - 0) / 2 = 2^0*a1 + 2^1*a2 +...

a1 is 1 -> because 51 is odd

=> 25 = (51 - 1) / 2 = 2^0*a2 + 2^1*a3 +...

a2 is 1

=> 12 = a3 + 2*a4 + ...

a3 is 0

=> 6 = a4 + 2*a5 + ...

a4 is 0

3 = a5 + 2*a6 + ...

a5 is 1

=> 1 = a6 + 2*(...)

a6 is 1

so we get 1100110 unsigned integer representation with 7 bits,

but we need 8 bit 2's complement one, so here it is:

01100110

#### b.

64 = 2^6 so its representation is simply:

1 and 6 0's and 0 for sign => 01000000

#### c.

33 = 32 + 1 = 2^5 + 2^0 => we get its appropriate coefisients:

00100001

#### d.

2's complement representations minimum negative number is
-2^7 which is -128 and its representation is 10000000.

#### e.

8 bits maximum positive number represented is 2^7 - 1 which is
127.

it has a positional binary representation, where first bit is 0,
so we have maximum such representation -> 01111111

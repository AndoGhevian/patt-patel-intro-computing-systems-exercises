1. a. What is the largest exponent the IEEE standard allows for a 32-bit floating point number?
1. b. What is the smallest exponent the IEEE standard allows for a 32-bit floating point number?

#### a.

largest actual scientific number's exponent possible to get
with excess code (bias) exponent encoding within 32 bits, where
8 bits actually used for this code, is:

11..11 (8 bits of 1) - 1 - bias 127 = 2^8 - 1 - 1 - bias 127 = 

= 2^8 - 2^7 + 1 - 2 = 2^7 - 1 = 127

#### b.

Given only nomalized for IEEE considering when exponent
is not 11...11 and not 000...000 then we get minimum
exponent of 000...01 - 127 = -126.

But, if we consider all normalized numbers scientific notation
can express, then in case if we want to express numbers smaller
than smallest normalized representable form, which is:

+1.0000...0 * 2^-126 = 2^-126

we should consider smallest subnormal number's exponent when it is
represented in normalized scientfic form.

maxmum of which is 0.111...111 * 2^-126 where there are 23 1's,
and so it is less from 2^126 by the smallest representable
subnormal number 0.0000....0001 * 2^-126.

now lets represnt this smallest subnormal float in normalized
scientific notation:

1.0 * 2^-23 * 2^-126 = 1.0 * 2^-149 we get, so:

-149 is the smallest exponent possibleto represent.
